The following describes the process when the user is visiting the website for the first time. This information is stored locally for later use.

The user first goes to myBank home page,
from there they can click on signin/signup button,
they get redirected to signin/signup page, there will be a button of either selecting signin or sign up. They will not be able to select sign in as signedUp is set to False.
since, the user does not have a account setup yet, they click the sign up option and enter desired username and a login password.
after signing up they get redirected to the preferences page, this is where they decide their desired preferences.
They will not be able to use the other hyperlinks to navigate during this process as preferencesSet is set to False. If True they will be redirected to the bank accounts page.
